Me a video similar to [Golang + HTMX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9H6vYelYyU)
and improve on:
- Error handling
- Optimistic UI (instantaneously update UI, then validate with incoming reponse from server)
- Use more features of htmx
- Why htmx is better than the conventional React
- Visualise data exchange between server and client (when updating content on page)
